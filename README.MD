# Comparing Front-end Frameworks

## Install
Run ```npm run install-all```
This will go through all the sub projects and run npm i. If it fails, simply run ```npm i``` in all 4 project folders "Angular/React/Vue/Svelte".

When installation is done, you'll need to create a .env file in the React/Vue/Svelte folders.
You should find an .env.example in each folder. Simply rename that file and fill in the required fields with your Firestore credentials.
For Angular, you'll need to check the environments folder.

All apps come with multi-language support.
The Svelte one was self-made so might be lacking in some ways.
